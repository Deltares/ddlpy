(D)ata (D)istributie (L)aag is a service from Rijkswaterstaat for distributing water quantity data.
[Openearth](https://github.com/openearth) / [Fedor Baart](https://github.com/SiggyF) wrote an [API](https://github.com/openearth/ddlpy) in python to collect historial data. 

This package uses their framework to extend the API to collect latest observations.
